<h2>History of Pune</h2>
Dating its history back to the 9th century, the city of Pune was initially ruled by the <br> Yadava Empire of Deogiri. Later, in the year 1317, the Khalji Dynasty overthrew Yadavas and took it under their control of Islamic rule for the next 300 years. <br> Then, the Khalji Dynasty was overpowered by the Tughlaqs.

Pune came into recognition after it was under Maratha rule. Although the Maratha rule started in the early 1600s, <br> the power kept on shifting between the Mughals, the Bhosale, and the Adil Shahi Dynasty till the 17th century.<br> 

In 1625, Shahji Bhosale, who was the father of Shivaji Maharaj (the founder of the Maratha Empire), <br> began the construction of the Lal Mahal as his wife Jijabai and son were about to move there.<br>  The construction was completed in 1640 and Shivaji Maharaj stayed there for almost a decade.

After Shivaji’s death, Peshwas ruled the city and made several advancements to it.<br>  However, in 1761, after the 3rd battle of Panipat, the influence of Peshwas started declining and one fine day, Pune came under the power of the Britishers.

Once the Britishers took over their control, they established the administration in this region.<br>  Slowly and steadily, several things were designed in Pune and gradually, it gained recognition from people belonging to different regions from all over the world.
